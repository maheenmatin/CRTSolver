    "\n",
    "All solvers have their available memory limited to 4GB. They are all given the same timeout value (the time limit for each check-sat). They are all given the same 25 test files. The test files are in the form of SMT2 files containing non-linear integer equations. Files are divided into 3 groups: problems involving 1 constant, problems involving 2 constants and problems involving 3 constants. Each of these groups contain sub-groups of quadratic and cubic problems. There is a mixture of both satisfiable and unsatisfiable equations. There is a slight bias for the frequency of unsatisfiable cubic equations as these were found to be the most demanding equations, thus making them especially suitable for testing performance.\n"

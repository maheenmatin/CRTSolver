1. Use csv_combiner.py to create a combined .csv file 
with equation information and solver runtimes.
If any inconsistent SAT results are found, this will
be flagged in the terminal output.

2. Use latex_creator.py to create a .txt file
that can be copy-pasted into an empty LaTeX table.

3. Wherever no solver solved successfully,
the SAT column entry will be "?", 
so manually enter this information.
If any inconsistent SAT results were found in step 1,
manually check this information.
